2.0.0 2024-09-27
  - Updates stimuli/task-sfprescaled_presented_frequencies.csv and stimuli/task-sfprescaled_stim_description.csv.
  - All w_a values in both values have been replaced with their negative (e.g., 6.0 -> -6.0, -6.0 -> 6.0).
  - This reflects a bug found in the code for the creation of the stimuli, setting of the voxel population receptive field retinotopic angle, and calculation of stimulus orientation.
  - In all those cases, the polar angle was increasing clockwise, instead of counter-clockwise.
  - Because these bugs cancel each other out, there is no effect on the results presented in the paper.
  - See the GitHub repo containing this project's code for more details: https://github.com/billbrod/spatial-frequency-preferences
